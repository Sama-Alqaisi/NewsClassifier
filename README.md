# NewsClassifier
# Introduction
This project focuses on classifying news articles into categories such as politics, sports, and tech. It leverages various text embeddings and machine learning models to predict news categories accurately. The repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and a detailed presentation on preprocessing, model comparisons, and evaluation.

#Dataset Overview
The project uses two datasets:
- news_train: For training the models.
- news_test: For evaluating the models.

# Project Objectives
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data, including text normalization and tokenization.
- Model Building: Use various embeddings (Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, FastText, BERT) with different models (KNN, Decision Tree, GNB, BERT).
- Evaluation: Assess model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Core Components
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze news trends and data distributions.
- Machine Learning: Train and evaluate models using different embeddings.
- Result Analysis: Compare model performance across different embeddings and evaluate their effectiveness.

# Tools & Libraries Used
- Python: Programming language for data processing and modeling.
- Pandas, NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating KNN, Decision Tree, and GNB models.
- Transformers (Hugging Face): For BERT embeddings and model.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.

# Documentation
The project includes:
- Jupyter Notebooks: Contains code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- Presentation: Details preprocessing steps, model comparisons (using Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, FastText, BERT embeddings), and overall performance evaluation.
